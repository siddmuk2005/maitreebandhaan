/**
 * [Google Cloud Video Intelligence API](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence)
 * makes videos searchable, and discoverable, by extracting metadata with an
 * easy to use REST API. You can now search every moment of every video file in
 * your catalog and find every occurrence as well as its significance. It
 * quickly annotates videos stored in Google Cloud Storage, and helps you
 * identify key nouns entities of your video, and when they occur within the
 * video. Separate signal from noise, by retrieving relevant information at the
 * video, shot or per frame.
 *
 * <h2>This is an auto-generated API</h2>
 *
 * It does not follow the conventions you're familiar with from other parts of
 * our library. A handwritten layer is not yet available.
 *
 * The example below shows you how to instantiate the generated client. For
 * further documentation, please browse the
 * [Video Intelligence .proto files](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/videointelligence/v1beta1/video_intelligence.proto)
 * on GitHub.
